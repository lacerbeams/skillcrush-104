			<h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you're learning how to code, it can be overwhelming. Especially if you've never done it before. Even the best teacher may not be able to get through to you if you're having a hard time grasping a particular concept or following a particular set of instructions.</p>

			<p>Luckily, you have the most powerful tool at your fingertips, regularly accessible, for free!</p>

			<h4>All the world's knowledge, a few keystrokes away.</h4>
			<p>The programming community, and largely the internet in general, is very open in nature. Whether we're talking about people all over the world collaborating on open-source programs, or simply forums full of peers sharing knowledge to help one another, there are so many people using the internet that it's very easy to find the answer to practically any question or problem you may have.</p>

			<p>This is the most comforting part about learning any new skill, especially programming.</p>

			<p>So, don't worry. Everyone will get stuck occasionally, even seasoned veterans. But you have the whole world backing you up!</p>
